# Intelligent-Line-Following-Robot

## Infrared 

In this implementation a Propeller P2X8C4M64P chip was used. The Propeller is a multicore chip and was used to control the line following algorithm, 
and the other peripherals such as the mini LCD, ultrasonic sensor and LED's.

## Infrared + Vision

In this implementation a Raspberry Pi was used alongside the Propeller P2X8C4M64P. The Propeller controlled the line following algorithm, 
same as the infrared only implementation, and the RPi controlled the camera and the detection of blocks along the track.
